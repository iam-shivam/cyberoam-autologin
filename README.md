<b><i>Fed up of Cyberoam? Hate those data limits colleges set? Here's your entry to the good days.</i></b>
<br/>
It takes a range of IDs(given to you by your college or whoever uses Cyberoam) and tries various passwords on them.
At the end of all the processing and waiting(sadly without internet access) you get a list of matched IDs along with their passwords.
<br/><br/>
<b>How to run it?</b>
- I use <b>tampermonkey</b> on Google Chrome. You can use any similar browser extension.
- Create a new script and copy everything there.
- In the predefined options, set your cyberoam address for login page to @match. For example,<br/>
  @match    http://175.16.89.16:8888/<br/>
  This is <b>important</b> because this will tell where to run the script.
- Set your list of common passwords. I have already set a few example ones and marked the location with a comment.
- Set starting id. Marked.
- Set ending id. Marked.
- Open your cyberoam login page.
